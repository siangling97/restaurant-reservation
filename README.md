# Restaurant Reservation System

## Project Goals
Capstone project for Periodic Tables, a startup creating a reservation system for fine dining restaurants. This software is used by restaurant personnel to manage reservations over the phone.

## Features

### Create a Reservation

- Fields include name, mobile number, date, time (starting from 10:30 AM), and number of guests.
- Form and server-side validation with error handling.

### Search
- Search for existing reservations by mobile number.
- Flexible search input (any combination or length of numbers).

### Create a New Table
- Create tables with a name and capacity (1-8).
- Front-end and back-end validation.

### Edit a Reservation
- Edit existing reservations with pre-filled forms.
- Same validation as "Create a Reservation."

### Cancel a Reservation
- Cancel booked reservations with confirmation prompt.
